### Scenario
You sit quietly, the weather suddenly changes and death flies up to you on a cloud with a scythe and says:

- *you'll be finished soon.*

But you answer her:

- *I'm a king! And I'll delay the inevitable.*

And she flies away and all sorts of monsters come in waves, but in the end you die and a sign appears:

- The inevitable cannot be delayed.

And you can start again, see the result and more
